Named after the Siemens' [passenger cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Venture), VentureOS is my hobby operating
system written in C# and based on the [Cosmos](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos) framework. It is the spiritual successor to my earlier project, [TOMAS](https://github.com/tonytins/tomas/).
